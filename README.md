# 🐙📈 SquidStock — Charting Squid Catch Trends & Sustainable Fisheries

**SquidStock** is part of the curated public side of the `Squid_Fest` project, focusing on 20 years (2000–2020) of *Illex argentinus* catch data.<br><br> 
Let’s set the scene:<br> 
**SquidStack** dove deep into pollutant bioindicators — like exploring a remote underwater trench which is rare, rigorous, and deeply exploratory — while **SquidStock** surveyed the ocean shelf and coastal waters (including that same trench), using stock assessments, environmental modeling, and predictive tools to surface hidden patterns across familiar seas.
> 🛂 This repository hosts curated dashboards and analysis. The full research pipeline and experimental modules live in the private `Squid_Fest` repo. To request access or collaborate, [email me](mailto:euchiejnpierre@gmail.com).

Though stock assessments are relatively common in finfish fisheries, they are much less frequent in squid fisheries, particularly with rich environmental modeling and predictive dashboards — that’s where this project brings novelty.

## 📂 Repository Structure

- `/notebooks` — Jupyter notebooks including The Navigation Course. Each notebook has its own README.md (like this one).  
- `/outputs` — Generated static plot PDFs and summary tables.  
- `/data` — Raw and processed datasets.

## 🎯 Objectives

- Normalize catch data through CPUE modeling  
- Examine relationships between catch and environmental variables  
- Forecast biomass responses under climate variability  
- Build predictive models using AutoML  
- (Future) Deploy models and manage them in a reproducible workflow

## 🛠 Tools & Techniques Used

- **Data & Arrays:** `pandas`, `numpy`, `xarray`, `netCDF4`  
- **Statistical & Predictive Modeling:** `pygam`, `statsmodels` (GAM, GLM, Tweedie)  
- **AutoML / Machine Learning:** `scikit-learn`, `PyCaret`  
- **Spatial & Dashboard Tools:** `folium`, `plotly`, `streamlit`  
- **Remote Sensing Processing:** extraction of Chlorophyll‑a and SSH from NetCDF layers  
- **Missing Data Imputation:** median of nearby spatial/temporal neighbors — chosen for stability across gaps and variable neighbor distributions  
- **Development Environment:** Jupyter Notebooks, VSCode  

---

## 📌 Data & Method Highlights

- Base dataset included: `catch_kg`, `longitude`, `latitude`, `vessel_id`, `SST`, `depth`, `year`, `month`, `day`  
- Augmented with satellite layers (Chlorophyll‑a, SSH) pulled from NASA / Copernicus portals  
- Missing environmental values imputed via median of local neighbors to mitigate influence of extreme values or sparse coverage  
- Modeling workflows:
  - GAMs, GLMs for CPUE normalization and prediction  
  - Environmentally dependent surplus production model for biomass forecasts  
  - AutoML experiments for short-term catch prediction
