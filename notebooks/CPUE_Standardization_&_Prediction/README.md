# üìò Module 2 ‚Äî CPUE Standardization & Modeling (2010‚Äì2020)

This notebook advances the *SquidStock* analytical series by standardizing and modeling *Illex argentinus* catch data (2010‚Äì2020).  
Building on the exploratory work in **Module 1**, it applies **Generalized Additive Models (GAMs)** and **Tweedie GLMs** to remove effort bias and reveal underlying ecological structure in **Catch Per Unit Effort (CPUE)**.

---

## üéØ Executive Summary

This module develops a **robust, reproducible workflow** for CPUE standardization using a 10-year subset (**January ‚Äì June each year**).  
These months were selected for their **consistent data coverage** across all years, ensuring comparability and avoiding partial-year bias.

To address missing satellite-derived environmental data (Chl-a, SSH, Depth), **linear interpolation** was applied ‚Äî filling temporal gaps while preserving natural monthly trends.  
Linear interpolation estimates missing values between two known points using a straight-line assumption, making it transparent and appropriate for smooth, seasonal environmental data.

### üîç Key Insights
- **GammaGAM** and **TweedieGLM** delivered superior fit and stability relative to log-transformed GAMs.  
- **5-fold cross-validation** confirmed **GammaGAM** slightly outperformed others, while **TweedieGLM** remained most robust under overdispersion.  
- Residual diagnostics showed well-behaved errors and minimal bias.  
- Seasonal peaks (March ‚Äì May) persisted after standardization, confirming **biological (e.g migration) rather than effort-driven** variability.

Together, these findings validate flexible, distribution-aware models as strong tools for squid fishery standardization.

## üåê Environmental Data & Pre-Processing

Environmental predictors were extracted from **NASA MODIS** and **Copernicus Marine Service** products and merged by `date √ó location`.

### ‚öôÔ∏è Missing Data Handling
- **Temporal gaps** in SST, SSH, and Chl-a were filled using **linear interpolation**.  
- **Spatial gaps** were imputed via nearest-neighbor lookups to preserve local gradients.  
- This ensured continuous predictors across the Jan‚ÄìJun subset without introducing unrealistic variability.

## üìä Workflow Overview

1. **Data Filtering:** Retain only **Jan‚ÄìJun** months per year.  
2. **Exploratory Analysis:** Examine CPUE distributions, environmental variability, and correlations.  
3. **Yearly Summary:** Compute mean ¬± SD for key variables (Jan‚ÄìJun subset).  
4. **Modeling:** Fit LinearGAM, GammaGAM, and Tweedie GLM frameworks.  
5. **Evaluation:** Compare performance metrics (RMSE / MAE).  
6. **Diagnostics:** Inspect residuals and fitted vs observed trends.  
7. **Outputs:** Generate standardized CPUE time-series and visual summaries.

## üìà Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

### üìä CPUE Distribution
Raw CPUE is **strongly right-skewed**, dominated by a few very large catches.  
After **log transformation**, the distribution approaches normality ‚Äî a key assumption for regression modeling.

### üóìÔ∏è Monthly CPUE Variability (Jan‚ÄìJun)
Boxplots reveal peaks between **March and May**, consistent with seasonal migration of the South Patagonian Stock.  
High interquartile ranges during these months suggest environmental or operational variability.

### üå°Ô∏è CPUE vs Temperature
A slight **negative correlation** appears ‚Äî higher SST tends to coincide with lower CPUE, hinting that warming may reduce catchability.

‚úÖ *These EDA insights justify using flexible, non-Gaussian models (Gamma / Tweedie) to capture ecological complexity.*

## üìâ Yearly Summary (2000 ‚Äì 2020, Jan‚ÄìJun Subset)

| Variable | Trend | Interpretation |
|-----------|--------|----------------|
| **Monthly CPUE mean** | ‚Üì Declining | Highly variable; overall decrease from early 2000s (‚âà14 605 kg) to 2019 (‚âà 4 053 kg). Suggests declining productivity or catchability. |
| **Water Temperature mean** | ‚Üë Increasing | Gradual warming (‚âà 10.99 ‚Üí 11.41 ¬∞C). May drive squid to deeper / southern waters, lowering CPUE. |
| **SSH mean** | ‚Üë Increasing | Rising SSH (0.01 ‚Üí 0.08 m) could signal reduced upwelling and nutrient supply, impacting productivity. |
| **Chlorophyll-a mean** | ‚Üí Stable / slightly decreasing | Mixed pattern; productivity fluctuations don‚Äôt always boost CPUE, indicating trophic mismatch. |
| **Depth mean** | ‚Üë Increasing | Fishing depth rose (‚âà 92 ‚Üí 152 m), implying migration to cooler zones. May reflect adaptive fishing or habitat shifts. |

## üß≠ Interpretation of Model Results

- **Gamma GAM**: Most stable residuals; fits right-skewed CPUE effectively.  
- **Tweedie GLM**: Resilient to overdispersion; strongest on variable data.  
- **Log GAMs**: Underpredict high CPUE due to transformation compression.  
- **Standardized Indices**: Seasonal peaks persist ‚Üí biologically driven variation.  

‚úÖ These diagnostics confirm **robust, ecologically meaningful** standardization.

## üìâ Limitations & Future Work

- Data restricted to **Jan‚ÄìJun** ‚Üí while this ensures temporal consistency across years, it excludes potential **late-season dynamics (Jul‚ÄìDec)**, which may slightly limit full-year representativeness.  
- Linear interpolation assumes steady change; future versions may test splines or spatiotemporal models.  
- Expanding predictor set (wind, salinity, front indices) could enhance ecological resolution.
